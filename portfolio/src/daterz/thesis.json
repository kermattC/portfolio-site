            "description": "Trained machine learning models to predict ink placement when writing in midair, and investigated how people prefer to write in the midair. I developed a VR data-gathering application where users can perform midair handwriting, which I later used in human experiments to gather midair handwriting data. Then I performed data processing and analysis, which led to training a total of 72 models to predict the intention of midair handwriting. Resulted in overall 85% accuracy. Lastly I performed qualitative analysis to see which methods people prefer to write in midair, as well as whether they prefer a virtual whiteboard as a form of assistance.",
