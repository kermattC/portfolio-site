                I've developed applications for my research throughout my academic journey - including a mobile AR data visualization application for my bachelor's thesis and a VR data-gathering application for my master's thesis, which involved using the collected data for machine learning analysis.
                After graduating, I decided to pursue full-stack development.

                I'm always learning new technologies to improve my skillset. 
                Nowadays I'm focused on React and Redux for frontend development, and NodeJS and Express for creating RESTful APIs. 
                I've also integrated databases in my full stack applications, including PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
                Lastly, I love showing off my projects to my friends by using AWS for its cloud services, and Docker for containerizing my apps. 
            </p>

                Outside of coding, I'm getting better at baseball, customizing keyboards and playing guitar.
